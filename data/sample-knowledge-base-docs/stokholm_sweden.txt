Stockholm is the capital and largest city of Sweden, with nearly 2 million inhabitants within its vicinities.

The inner city is made up of 14 islands connected by some 50 bridges on Lake Mälaren, which flows into the brackish Baltic Sea, and passes the Stockholm archipelago with some 24,000 islands and islets.

Stockholm is a cosmopolitan place with both classical and modern architecture, and a captivating Old Town, Gamla Stan. Over 30% of the city area is made up of waterways, and another 30% is made up of green spaces. Air quality is fourth best of the European capitals - behind Zurich, Copenhagen and Vienna.
Districts

This article gives an overview of the Stockholm metropolitan area, Stor-Stockholm, which includes Stockholm County except Norrtälje municipality, which is in Roslagen.
Black: Old town, Red: Norrmalm, Orange: Östermalm, Yellow: Södermalm, White: Kungsholmen, Dark green: Ekerö, Blue: Lidingö, Pale blue: Stockholm archipelago, Pink: Västerort, Magenta: Norrort, Green: Söderort, Dark red: Södertörn.

Most venues are found in the inner city, "innerstaden", historically the zone within the city tolls. The Municipality of Stockholm extends beyond the inner city, including the western and southern suburbs.
The inner city
	Norrmalm
Norrmalm contains the central business district known as City, with several department stores and shopping malls, museums, hotels and restaurants too many to mention, most of Stockholm's major theatres, and the central railway station. The pedestrian shopping street Drottninggatan runs in a north-south direction through the area, by the square Sergels Torg. The islets Skeppsholmen and Kastellholmen can be reached on foot. Vasastan is a mainly residential area, where the Odenplan square offers shopping and nightlife.
	Östermalm
Östermalm is an affluent borough, including Nationalstadsparken, "the National City Park". The Stureplan square is a hub for upmarket shopping and nightlife. Södra Djurgården or simply Djurgården is an island-park, with several major tourist venues - the Skansen open air museum, the Gröna Lund amusement park, and the Vasa Museum. The borough also contains a forest, a museum cluster with the Science and Technology Museum and Kaknästornet, as well as Stockholm University and the Royal Institute of Technology. The Frihamnen cruise port is on the eastern edge.
	Gamla Stan
An island with great waterfront views, the northern part of the Old Town is dominated by the Royal Palace and the Swedish Parliament. The rest of the island is a picturesque collection of old buildings and narrow cobblestone streets. The adjacent island Riddarholmen holds a church and several old government buildings.
	Södermalm
Södermalm is a rugged island with buildings of all ages. It is always commonly referred to as Söder (The South). Fjällgatan offers some of the best views of Stockholm and the Baltic Sea inlet. The major north-south street Götgatan and adjacent streets are littered with a variety of restaurants, bars and shops. It starts like a hump next to Slussen with the busy pedestrian zone called Götgatsbacken ("The slope of Götgatan"), and passes Medborgarplatsen ("Citizens' square"), which has plenty to offer in terms of shopping and night life. The "bohemian" area south of Folkungagatan is occasionally nicknamed "SoFo", with obvious inspiration from SoHo. Among its variety of restaurants, cafés, pubs, odd shops and trendy boutiques one will encounter the most liberal assembly of successful but also wannabe Swedes. Shopping and exposing their offspring at the idyllic square Nytorget or just basking in the lovely park Vita Bergen. At Skeppargränd people still inhabit an entire block of remaining small wooden houses along cobbled streets from a bygone era. Långholmen is a lush island off Södermalm. This is where the notorious prison Långholmsfängelset is situated. The cells have since been converted into small hotel rooms, and the sometimes macabre history of this historical complex is displayed in cabinets. The waterfront has some of central Stockholm’s most popular beaches and there is also room for nudists on some of the cliffs.
	Kungsholmen
Kungsholmen is an island at the western inner city, with Stadshuset (Stockholm City Hall) at its eastern tip. Further west, a collection of relaxed neighbourhood bars and restaurants can be found. West of the Fridhemsplan transport hub and the Västermalmsgallerian shopping mall, the island is more suburban. Lilla Essingen and Stora Essingen are two smaller, mainly residential, islands that belong to the borough of Kungsholmen. Close to the park Rålambshovsparken is a nice natural beach, Smedsuddsbadet, suitable for children.
Suburbs and bordering towns


	Western Suburbs
The Western suburbs, Västerort, were built up during the late 20th century. Stockholm-Bromma Airport dominates the area. Vällingby, founded in the 1950s, is one of Europe's first planned suburbs. Solvalla is a prominent horse-race stadium. Kista is an international centre of information technology, also known for the busy shopping mall Kista Galleria and the landmark skyscrapers Kista Science Tower and Victoria Tower.
	Northern Suburbs
the Northern suburbs contain

        Solna and Sundbyberg, just north of central Stockholm, are two separate cities within the Storstockholm (Greater Stockholm) area. Solna is the home of Friends Arena, the region's largest stadium, the vast royal park and recreational area Hagaparken, and the Karolinska Institute, a leading institution of medical research. Haga slott (palace) in Hagaparken is currently the home of crown princess Victoria and her family. Sundbyberg is the smallest municipality in Sweden and sometimes referred to as "Sumpan".

        Danderyd and Täby, to the north-east, are affluent municipality suburbs that can be reached by underground and bus or Roslagsbanan, a narrow-gauge railway. Danderyd used to have the lowest income tax In Sweden and the Djursholm area displays some of the most expensive private homes in the whole country. Täby centrum claims to be one of the biggest shopping malls in Scandinavia. The horse-race track Täby Galopp has now closed and weeds are now growing there

. Runriket at Jarlabankes bro in Täby kyrkby is the gateway to the world's largest collection of Viking Age standing stones with narrations carved in runic script. The museum trail is always open and stretches many miles along public roads and pathways into the municipality Vallentuna. Nearby Täby kyrka (church) holds some of the most vivid medieval wall paintings in the country.
	Stockholm archipelago
The Archipelago, Stockholms skärgård, contains

        Vaxholm is the gateway to the northern Stockholm archipelago, and a ferry hub. The town has a great waterfront view and a quaint small-scale shopping area. It also sports Vaxholms fästning, which is a fortress turned into a coastal defense museum.
        Värmdö, the largest island, similar to the mainland.
        Sandhamn, a resort-island in the outer archipelago.
        Utö, a rural island with an abandoned silver-mine.

	Lidingö
Lidingö is a separate city within the Storstockholm (Greater Stockholm) area. Situated on a large island just east of central Stockholm it boasts affluent suburbs, small town centers and quaint rural areas. Points of interests are Millesgården: an impressive open-air sculpture museum; Bosön: a national sports facility; Ekholmsnäs: a ski slope; and Elfvik: a farmland with an array of conference hotels. Lidingö is reached by Lidingöbron (Lidingö bridge) and buses from Ropsten terminal station on the red underground line.
	Ekerö
Ekerö in Lake Mälaren is the only Swedish municipality with two UNESCO World Heritage sites: Royal residence Drottningholm and Viking Age settlements Birka on the island Björkö alongside Hovgården on the island Adelsö. The islands also contain manors, farms, forests and beaches.
	Southern suburbs
The southern parts of Stockholm municipality, Söderort, is best known for the stadium cluster: Globen the Globe Arena, clearly visible from most of Södermalm, host ice-hockey games as well as international artist performances, the smaller Hovet and the football arena Tele 2 Arena. Nearby Skogskyrkogården (The Woodland Cemetery), [1], is a UNESCO [2] World Heritage site. To the south-west of the inner city, the borough Liljeholmen has a pleasant recreational area around lake Trekanten.
	Södertörn
Södertörn is the peninsula of eastern Södermanland (actually, Södertörn-Nacka is technically Sweden's third biggest island). Except Stockholm's southern suburbs, it contains:

        Nacka and Värmdö, to the south-east, are suburban municipalities with large recreational areas and much of the southern part of the Stockholm Archipelago.
        Huddinge, Haninge and Tyresö to the south are residential suburban municipalities with large recreational areas, including the large Tyresta virgin forest, one of 28 national parks in Sweden, where the oldest pine trees are around 400 years old.
        Södertälje, a city with a distinct history where the Baltic sea meets lake Mälaren in Sweden's biggest lock. Södertälje is the home of Tom tits - Stockholm's biggest science center for children, the Torekällberget outdoor museum, and Tvetagården - a well known hostel just by lake Måsnaren.
        Nynäshamn, a coastal vacation town with the ferry to Gotland.

Understand
The Royal Guard on parade at the Royal Palace

Stockholm is not the oldest town in Sweden. As Sigtuna, Sweden's first capital, was sacked by pirates in 1187, the Swedes built up fortresses along the inlet of Mälaren, and Birger Jarl (Jarl is a title corresponding to British Earl) had a fortress built on an island later known as Gamla Stan. The first records of Stockholm were written in 1252 by Birger. As the land raised, the Stockholm straits became the only waterway between Mälaren and the Baltic Sea during the 15th century, replacing Uppsala as the effective capital. Since King Gustavus Vasa liberated Stockholm in 1523, Stockholm has remained Sweden's most important centre of commerce, though Gothenburg later became the largest international port. During the 17th century, Stockholm was the base of the Swedish Empire, with a land area twice the country's current size, nearly encircling the Baltic Sea.

The city contains buildings from all ages since the 13th century. Like the rest of Sweden it was untouched by the World Wars, but particularly between 1955 and 1975, hundreds of old buildings in Norrmalm were demolished in a large-scale modernization process, encouraged by similar projects in other European cities. Since then, only infills and a few areas have been developed with new architecture in central Stockholm.

Average conditions for Stockholm

Despite its northern location, Stockholm has fairly mild temperatures throughout the year. As a result of its northerly latitude, the city sees a dramatic seasonal variation in sunlight, from more than 18 hours of daylight around midsummer, to around 6 hours of daylight in late December. Stockholm enjoys an average of nearly 2,000 hours of sunshine a year. Average yearly precipitation is 539 mm (21.2"), with July and August slightly the wettest months.
Sergels Torg in the evening

Throughout the summer, the average daily high temperatures reach 20-25°C (68-77°F), with lows of 12-15°C (54-59°F). However, summer heat waves are frequent and temperatures above 25°C+ (77°F+) are not uncommon. Autumn tends to be rather cool and often rainy; in October, average daily highs dip to approximately 10°C (50°F). In the winter months, from December through early March, average daily temperatures fall between -3 and 3°C (26-38°F). Milder periods occur, but so do cold spells with temperatures around -10°C (14°F). Snowfall can occur from late November to early April, but the amount of snowfall varies greatly from year to year and through the winter season. Deep snow cover throughout the winter is rather uncommon. Spring is the driest season, with average daily temperature reaching highs of 9°C (48°F) in April and 16°C (61°F) in May.
Tourist information

    Stockholm Tourist Center, Kulturhuset, Sergels Torg 5 (T T-Centralen), [3]. Open M-F 09:00-18:00, Sa 9:00-16:00, Su 10:00-16:00. The official tourist centre has a lot of information in English and helpful staff. They also sell tickets to museums and sightseeing tours.

Get in
By plane

    Stockholm-Arlanda Airport, commonly referred to as Arlanda (IATA: ARN; ICAO: ESSA) is the main international airport (served by SAS [4], BA [5] and many others) and is located 40 km (25 mi) north of the city, in the Sigtuna municipality.
    There are several methods for travelling between Stockholm and Arlanda, listed in order of popularity:
        Express Buses
            Flygbussarna [6] runs buses frequently to and from the City Terminal, just next to the Central Station. The journey takes 45 minutes and the buses make a few stops in the northern suburbs, as well as Vasastaden, along the way. The bus has a display showing upcoming stops - make sure to press the button to request your stop. Tickets can be purchased at electronic kiosks in the airport (cards only), online, or from the driver (cards only). Ticket costs one-way/return:
                Online
                    Adult 99/198 SEK
                    Youth 89/178 SEK
                    Family 349/698 SEK
                At Airport
                    Adult 119/215 SEK
                    Youth 99/179 SEK
                    Family 349/698 SEK
            Swebus [7] runs buses to and from the City Terminal, 1-4 times/hour Mon-Fri, 1-2 times/hour on Sat-Sun. The journey takes 35-45 minutes. Adult tickets cost 99 SEK/178 SEK return. Student and senior tickets cost 72 SEK each way. A ticket for youth under 20 costs 60 SEK each way. Four children up to age 16 travel free with full paying adult. You can't buy tickets with cash on board, but credit cards are accepted. There are multiple outlets at the airport to buy your ticket electronically. You can also buy your ticket e.g. on the Swebus site on the internet, by phone (0771-218 218), at 7-Eleven, Pressbyrån and Swebus ticket offices.
        By express rail: The Arlanda Express Train [8], departs from the lower level of each airport terminal every 15 minutes and arrives at Stockholm Central Station in 20 minutes. Adult tickets normally cost 295 SEK one-way, 570 SEK return. Tickets for people under the age of 25 (ISIC discount no longer available) pay 165 SEK. Children under 17 travel free with a paying adult. Tickets can be bought from kiosks at the platform, online, or on the train for a 100 SEK surcharge. There are two primary ways to save money on tickets, which are available online only. Early-Bird tickets, bought online cost 195 SEK 7-days in advance. Second, during Thursday-Sunday, holidays and from everyday between June 18 and August 30, tickets cost 350 SEK for 2 adults traveling together one-way (+100 SEK for each additional adult up to 4).
        By regular rail: Regular trains serve the airport through a third station, Arlanda Central, located under Sky City between terminal 4 and 5.
            Line 40 of the Stockholm suburban rail, pendeltåg, runs from Uppsala via Stockholm Central Station to Södertälje, stopping in the northern suburbs along the way. The train runs twice an hour and takes 37 minutes to Stockholm, and local transport tickets can be used and bought at the entrance to the station, though everyone 18 of age has to pay a station access fee of 120 SEK (though young adults with a teenage appearance can easily claim to be under 18 and get through - the staff usually won't check your ID if you're confident about this). A one-way ticket to Stockholm city costs 158 SEK including the station access fee (145 SEK for students and pensioners). People under 18 pay no additional access fee at Arlanda, so the ticket price is the standard fare for a single ticket. In 2017, SL abandoned the zone system for fares, so a single ticket costs the same regardless of the length travelled, and is valid for 70 minutes (the exception being journeys to Arlanda, Knivsta, or Uppsala). Single journeys bought using the SL Access card (has to be pre-loaded with a minimum of 100 SEK) cost 32 SEK for adults aged 18 and over, compared to 45 SEK for physical or mobile tickets. Students, pensioners and people under 18 pay a discounted fare of 22 SEK (32 SEK for physical or mobile tickets). For 130 SEK (90 SEK for students, pensioners and people under 18) you can get a 24-hour travelcard. 3-day and weekly travelcards are also available. See [9] for local transport tickets.
            There are also faster regional trains on the Linköping – Stockholm – Gävle route, which cost 278 SEK (2nd class) to central Stockholm if bought on the spot, though if booked approx. 1–2 months in advance, they can be as cheap as 95 SEK. They run non-stop and take 20 minutes, like the Arlanda Express, but only operate hourly (with several strange gaps), but if you are on time the regional train can be much cheaper than Arlanda Express, though not quite as cheap as suburban rail or SL bus. Finally, long-distance trains from Stockholm operate to points in central Sweden, such as Umeå, Mora or Östersund. It is not, however, permitted to use these trains to travel from the airport to central Stockholm. See [10] for regional/intercity rail tickets.
        By local bus and rail combination [11]: This is the cheapest way into the city center. If the station access fee for the direct suburban rail service bothers you, local bus 583 connects the airport to Märsta railway station, and from Märsta you can change to the suburban train (lines 41 and 42) to get you to Odenplan and Stockholm Central Station in 65 minutes. The departures of the suburban train (pendeltåg) are timed with bus arrivals from the airport, so you do not need to worry about planning ahead. This route costs 38 SEK if you have pre-loaded your SL Card (+20 SEK to buy Access Card), but if you are planning on buying a timed SL card anyway (24 hours, 72 hours, etc.) then this route becomes entirely free as it is included in your SL access. See the #Get Around section for more details on the SL services and ticketing system.
        By taxi: Major taxi companies operate on a fixed price basis between Arlanda and central Stockholm. Prices at the taxi stands currently range from 450 SEK (Transfer Taxi) to 520 SEK. Generally, you can freely choose among the waiting taxis or ask the operator for a specific company. There is free taxi pricing so beware of the smaller, expensive, taxi companies. A yellow and white sign with price comparison (per 10 km and 15 minutes) is on every taxi window, and the price should not ever be more than 350 SEK. A taxi ride to central Stockholm takes approximately 40 minutes. With some companies, you can get a lower price if you pre-book your ride. With Airport Cab (+46 8 25 25 23 [12]) the cost is 430 SEK from Arlanda to Stockholm, 390 SEK from Stockholm to Arlanda. With Taxi Solna (+46 8 280 280 [13]) the cost is 445 SEK from Arlanda to Stockholm, 350 SEK from Stockholm to Arlanda. See the Taxi section below for some general advice on taxi travel in Stockholm.
        By Car Sharing: There are a few car sharing companies located at the Arlanda Airport parking area, where you will be able to drive yourself to and from Arlanda Airport at a cheaper rate than a taxi.
        By car: See Sigtuna for car rental at Arlanda Airport.

    Bromma Airport, (IATA: BMA; ICAO: ESSB) is a smaller airport, located inside the city about 8 km west of the centre, mainly used for domestic flights, but also Copenhagen and Aarhus in Denmark, Oslo and Skien in Norway, Tallinn in Estonia and Brussels in Belgium.
        Airport coaches [14] offer a more expensive connection to the City Terminal at 79 SEK, taking 20 min.
        A cheaper option (36 SEK, 20 SEK for people under 20) is to take local bus 152 to Sundbyberg station, and from there a suburban train to Stockholm Central (taking 25 min in total). Another possibility is to take bus 110 or 112 to Alvik, and change to the metro which will take you directly to Stockholm Central.

    Skavsta Airport (IATA: NYO; ICAO: ESKN) mostly used by Ryanair and Wizzair, and offers flights from cities such as Berlin, Belgrade, Brussels, Budapest, Dublin, Edinburgh, London, Madrid, Prague, Rome, Skopje, Tallinn, Vilnius and Warsaw. Located 100 km (62 mi) southwest of Stockholm, near the town Nyköping.
        The easiest option is to take Airport coaches [15] go to/from the City Terminal in Stockholm. Adults 159 SEK app/online or 179 SEK at the bus terminal one way; For a round trip it will cost 318 SEK app/online, 325 SEK at the bus terminal. The travel time is about 80 minutes.
        A cheaper option if booked in advance is to take local bus 515 (timetable [16], M-F = Mo-Fr, L = Sa, SoH = Su + holidays) to Nyköping rail station (get off at Nyköping Centralstation), from where SJ regional trains (timetable [17]) on the Linköping - Stockholm - (Gävle) route connect to Stockholm (Gävle trains also serve Arlanda, thus providing a direct rail connection to Arlanda airport). The bus costs SEK 26 (SEK 13 for people below 20) and the train SEK 75-143 (SEK 67-127 for people below 26) depending on how early you book. Tickets can be bought the following two ways:
            1. Buy a combined ticket from Skavsta to Stockholm on SJ:s website [18] which is both valid on the local bus and the regional train.
            2. Pay for the local bus onboard with your VISA or Mastercard (cash is NOT accepted) and buy the train ticket at Nyköping station.

        Travel time from Skavsta is 80 min to Stockholm and 100 min to Arlanda airport.

    Västerås Airport (IATA: VST; ICAO: ESOW) is situated 100 km west of Stockholm near Västerås. Serves Ryanair flights to/from London (Stansted). Like Skavsta, Västerås can be reached in two ways:
        Airport coaches [19] go to/from the City Terminal in Stockholm. 139 SEK one way, 278SEK round trip, takes about 80 minutes.
        Local bus 3 runs between the airport and Västerås train station in 15 minutes, costing 26 SEK one way (12 SEK for people under 20 or above 65). From the station, regional trains on the Stockholm - Västerås - Örebro - (Göteborg) route (timetable [20], M-F = Mo-Fr, L = Sa, SoH = Su + holidays) connect to Stockholm in 55 min, costing SEK 75-143 (SEK 71-136 for people below 26) depending on how early you book [21]). Total travel time Västerås Airport - Stockholm this way is 75 min.

By train
Stockholm Main Train Station (main hall)

The main station, Stockholm Central, serves both commuter and long-distance routes. It is located in lower Norrmalm, connected to T-Centralen, the central hub for the subway system, and Cityterminalen, the long-distance bus station. The national rail company, SJ, has a store located inside the station, and a travel planner with ticket booking service on its web page [22].

Internationally, there are services from Copenhagen (Denmark) (5 h) and Oslo (Norway) (6 h) with several direct connections daily. Daily overnight trains are available from Hamburg (12 h) and the northern Norwegian city of Narvik (14 h). From Trondheim, a quick change in Östersund is needed.

There are numerous direct domestic services to Stockholm from most major cities. The major ones being high-speed X2000 services from Gothenburg (3 h), Malmö (4½ h), Sundsvall (3½ h) and Östersund (5 h). Conventional trains mostly follow the same routes, and run slightly slower, but can slash prices considerably. Most other mid-sized cities in Sweden have a train connection with Stockholm. Domestic night trains are available from Malmö, and from the northern cities of Luleå, Kiruna and Umeå.

The rail line has some very scenic views just south of Stockholm, passing over several bridges.

If looking for a bit of luxury, then a new train named Blå Tåget (Blue Train) [23] now travels the route Gothenburg-Stockholm-Uppsala daily except Fridays. It's slower than regular trains, taking a lengthy 4½ hours to reach Stockholm but has first class seatings and a real restaurant onboard. WiFi is included in the price.
By bus

The City Terminal (Cityterminalen [24]) is the main bus terminal, directly connected to Stockholm Central and the T Centralen subway station. There are multiple daily departures to most other cities in Sweden, as well as a few international routes. Swebus Express [25] operates routes to Copenhagen and Oslo with several daily departures, and a twice-weekly service to Berlin. Eurolines [26] has some departures to Copenhagen. Smaller operators offer connections with Prague, Budapest, Zagreb, Banja Luka[27] among other cities.
By boat
Kornhamnstorg, a waterfront square in the Old Town

The port of Stockholm consists of several port areas. In the summer Stadsgården, Skeppsbron and Frihamnen are the ports favoured by the international cruise liners (see cruising the Baltic Sea). Year round Värtahamnen, Frihamnen and Stadsgården have extensive ferry services, including the local Baltic Sea ferries.

The Baltic Sea ferries, locally known as finlandsbåtar ("Finland boat"), link Stockholm to Helsinki, Mariehamn and Turku in Finland, Riga in Latvia and Tallinn in Estonia every day. Stockholm is the main Swedish terminal for the Baltic Sea cruises. They are by far the cheapest way to get to and from these cities from Stockholm.

Note carefully that cities and places are written and pronounced differently in Finnish and Swedish. For instance: Suomi-Finland, Ruotsi-Sverige (Sweden), Tukholma-Stockholm, Helsinki-Helsingfors, Turku-Åbo, Ahvenanmaa-Åland, Maarianhamina-Mariehamn. This is a lesser case with other Baltic Sea countries.

If you intend to use the boats to travel to- or from- Stockholm, it is almost always cheaper to book a cruise (kryssning), or even two head-to-head cruises and discard the returns, rather than buy one-way tickets. Tickets can be had for as low as 80 SEK for a full 4-person cabin, making it practically the cheapest accommodation one can find in a high-income country - at 10 SEK/night/person for a two-night Stockholm-Helsinki return cruise (provided you book early or last minute during the weekdays), and rarely (even for a weekend cruise in high season) exceeds 400 SEK for the cheapest 4-bed cabin. A one-way ticket, for a shared berth, in comparison, usually exceeds 1000 SEK.

    Tallink [28] ferries to Mariehamn and Tallinn in Estonia depart from Värtahamnen port, and ferries to Riga in Latvia from Frihamnen port. For Värtahamnen, take the red underground line to Gärdet, exit at the front, and walk 400 metres to the terminal (the route is signposted).

    Frihamnen Magasin 2, go up escalator for ATM
    For Frihamnen, take the red underground line Gärdet, exit at the front and take bus 1 towards Frihamnen just outside the station. Go across the street in Magasin 2 for an ATM. From the Frihamnen terminal, bus 1 goes to the center of Stockholm (going along Kungsgatan, which is north of the central bus station and a block north of the central railway station). Alternatively, bus 76 towards Norra Hammarbyhamnen serves Södermalm via Kungsträdgården and Gamla stan. When leaving the Frihamnen terminal and heading inland, the bus stop is on the road around to the left across from the banana warehouse; it has a ticket machine that only accepts credit cards (i.e. does not take cash).

    Silja Line [29], owned by Tallink, has ferries to Mariehamn, Helsinki and Turku departing from Värtahamnen port. See directions above.

    Viking Line [30] ferries to Mariehamn, Helsinki and Turku depart from the eastern part of Stadsgårdsterminalen in northeastern Södermalm. To get there from the city centre, take the green or red underground lines to Slussen, and take the exit for Slussenterminalen. From there take the 401 - 422, 442 - 449 or 471 bus one single stop to Londonviadukten and the port will be on your left. Alternatively normal town buses 53 and 71 link Slussen and the Viking Line terminal, albeit via the backstreets. Yet another convenient but more expensive alternative is the shuttle buses operated by Flygbussarna that go directly from the terminal to the central bus station (Cityterminalen) in the city center. The price for a ticket on these are 45 SEK (single) and 70 SEK (return) and tickets are sold on board, at Flygbussarna's and Viking Line's booths in the bus station, and if you want to buy the ticket on the bus you can do it but only pay with a credit card. There are multiple departures from the port 15-60 min after the ferry arrives and from the station 1-3 hours before the ferry departs. If you are driving to the boat, follow the signs to Slussen, then Stadsgårdsterminalen (note that Slussen is confusing for even locals, so don't feel embarrassed if you end up spinning in the intersection a few times) and then Finland/Viking Line. There are big lockers at the ferry terminal for 5 euros or 50 kr.

    Birka Cruises [31] ferries to Mariehamn in Åland depart from Western Stadsgårdsterminalen, about 700 meters from Slussen (right in front of Viking's terminal). See above for instructions.

Stockholm Cruise Center in Frihamnen 638, 2009

    Holland America Cruises use Stadsgårdsterminalen in northeastern Södermalm for one-day port calls and Frihamnen for turnarounds (start and end of cruises). See above for instruction.

Get around
Public transport

Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SL (Stockholm Public Transport) [32] runs an extensive subway, commuter train and bus system as well as some light rail and ferry services, all using an integrated ticket system called "SL Access". The SL Access RFID card costs 20 SEK (good for six years) and can load all tickets available in the SL fare scheme. The paper strip coupon ticket system was discontinued as of 2013.

There are SL Travel Cards or passes on the SL network available for 24 hours (160 SEK, 105 SEK for for children/seniors), 72 hours (315 SEK, 210 SEK for for children/seniors), 7 days (415 SEK, 280 SEK for for children/seniors) plus 20 SEK card fee. If you are going to be in Stockholm for a while, go ahead and purchase a 30-day card, which allows unrestricted  access to all of the buses, trams, subways, and commuter trains, as well as the Djurgården ferry, for 950 SEK, 640 SEK for children/seniors. When you purchase the 72-hour Travel Card, you also receive free admission to Gröna Lund (see "See" below). Suburban ferries, airport buses, the Arlanda Express and regional trains are not part of the SL network, and thus not included in any of these tickets.

Travel cards and discount travel tickets may be bought in advance at SL Centres, “Pressbyrån” kiosks, or tourist information offices. Tickets cannot be bought from bus drivers. Instead, there are cash and credit card machines at most bus stops and metro entrances.

The SL website has detailed ticket and price information, and a journey planner. A better trip planner for Stockholm and Sweden is ResRobot[33] and best is its App for smartphones (iOS and Android).

Kindly note that SL doesn't have visible information before journey that there is no travel card reader aboard to pay journey. That is especially seen on the light rail/tram traffic Tvärbanan. In contrast to light rail & trams in Europe there is no reader in wagon and no visible information about that.

Metro

Stockholm Metro

Stockholm has a metro system called the Tunnelbana, commonly abbreviated T-bana, and symbolised with a blue T on a round white sign. With exactly 100 stations, it is extensive for a city of this size, and will get you around almost all the downtown places as well as many inner suburbs. Trains run from 05:00 to 01:00 on weekdays and around the clock on weekends. Night buses replace the trains on weekdays. The metro is probably the fastest way to travel to many inner suburbs not served by suburban rail, as well as offering a scenic view from the bridge between Gamla stan and Slussen.

The SL website offers a guide to the artwork that is featured in many subway stations, with nearly all stations offering some form of permanent artwork on display. The artwork on the blue line in particular is of note.

Directions in Stockholm are often accompanied by the name of the closest subway stop, using T as an abbreviation for "Tunnelbana", e.g. "T-Gamla stan". This practice is followed below when appropriate.
Suburban rail

Stockholm also has a suburban commuter rail network called Pendeltåg. Reaching 53 stations, including Uppsala, Knivsta and Bålsta in Uppsala län (county), plus Gnesta in Södermanlands län (county). There are six lines:

    40: Uppsala – Arlanda Airport – Stockholm C – Södertälje C
    41: Märsta – Stockholm C – Södertälje C
    42X: Märsta – Stockholm C – Nynäshamn (skip-stop train)
    43/43X: Bålsta – Stockholm C – Tungelsta – (Nynäshamn)
    44: (Bro) – Kallhäll – Älvsjö (peak hours only)
    48: Södertälje C – Gnesta (connects with lines 40 and 41 at Södertälje hamn)

Off-peak generally sees 4 tph (trains per hour) across the network, with the exception of Bålsta, Bro, and stations south of Tungelsta on lines 42, 43 and 43X, which see 2 tph. On line 48, trains run hourly during the off-peak. Additional services run during peak hours.

In the north-east, the Roslagsbanan narrow-gauge rail network connects the central Östermalm district with suburbs in the Danderyd, Täby, Vallentuna and Österåker municipalities.

    27: Stockholms östra - Roslags Näsby - Ormsta - (Lindholmen - Kårsta)
    28: Stockholms östra - Roslags Näsby - Åkersberga - (Österskär)
    29: Stockholms östra - Djursholms Ösby - Näsbypark

Off-peak sees 4 tph (1–2 tph in the bracketed section) on lines 27 and 28, 2 tph on line 29. The station Stockholms östra is directly adjacent to T-Tekniska högskolan on the red line towards Mörby centrum.

Saltsjöbanan starts adjacent to T-Slussen and reaches the suburbs Saltsjöbaden and Solsidan, south-east of the city. With Slussen being closed for renovation until 2025, Saltsjöbanan trains run from Henriksdal, with replacement buses connecting to Slussen.

Suburban trains are included in Stockholm's transport ticket system, with the exception of Knivsta and Uppsala on line 40, which employ Uppsala's local transport fares. It costs 96 SEK (60 SEK for youth) to get there if you already have an SL travelcard.
Light rail, tram, bus and ferry
A bus on line 69 in Stockholm

    Tvärbanan is a light rail line connecting the western and southern suburbs with a new section forming a 3/4 loop around Stockholm.

    Lidingöbanan connects Ropsten on Östermalm to Lidingö. This line provides a scenic view at the end of Lidingö across the archipelago. Several ferry services also call at Gåshaga brygga at the end of the line.

    Nockebybanan in the western suburbs connects the district of Nockeby to Alvik on the green line of the Tunnelbana. The buses heading to Drottningholm Palace call at Nockeby (although in practice, taking the bus from Brommaplan on the green line of the Tunnelbana is more efficient) as well as passing through the quaint garden-city of Bromma.

    Spårväg City is a city tram connecting Norrmalmstorg to Waldemarsudde on the Djurgården island, as serving the Nordiska Museet, Gröna Lund and Skansen.

    Buses serve most populated areas where rail does not reach. Four inner city main lines numbered from 1 to 6 are operated by large blue buses (weekdays every 3-10 minutes), the other, generally less frequent lines (weekdays 7-20 minutes), by red buses.

There are also ferries going to Djurgården and Skeppsholmen. Bus and light rail is included in any SL ticket or pass, and travel with the Djurgården ferry is included with any 24- or 72-hour pass, 7-day pass as well as the monthly pass. Suburban ferries, airport buses, the Arlanda Express and regional trains are not part of the SL network, and thus not included in any of these tickets.

There's an SL ferry called Sjövägen that runs between Nybroplan and Frihamnen with stops at Allmänna gränd (Djurgården), Saltsjöqvarn, Finnboda and Kvarnholmen in Nacka, Blockshusudden (Djurgården), Nacka strand and Dalénum (Lidingö). A second SL ferry line opened in 2016 connecting Kungsholms torg (Kungsholmen), Söder Mälarstrand (Södermalm) and Klara Mälarstrand, located between the City Hall and the Central Station. Apart from the fact that it's free (with a valid SL card), the boats also have free wifi (and electrical sockets), and even free tea and coffee. Some boats sell alcohol. At Blockhusudden and Nacka Strand, there are nice restaurants just by the water.
Bike
Stockholm City Bike stand.

Cycling is an attractive option during warm seasons, and there are many bikepaths. On a bike, a journey across the inner city takes no longer than 30 minutes, and can be faster than travelling by subway or car. There are cycle paths along most major streets and drivers are generally considerate towards cyclists. In winter, when paths can be covered by ice, extra care should be taken. Bikepaths have a bicycle painted on the ground and/or round blue signs with a white bike. Make sure you bike on the right hand side of the street, just as the cars.

    Bike Sweden ([34]) BikeSweden offers a variety of high quality bikes in the center of the city. From mountainbikes to childrens bikes and city bikes. Child carriers and child seats are available. Helmets and locks are included in the rental price. The bikes have at least 7 gears and are maximum of two seasons old. Very competitive pricing. Located at Narvavägen 13-17, in the front courtyard of the Historical Museum (Historiska Museet). Open 10:00-18:00 April-October. Call or email to rent bikes off season +46(0)8-52 52 7000, info@bikesweden.se

    Cykel- & Mopeduthyrningen, Strandvägen, Kajplats 24 (T Östermalmtorg or T Karlaplan). Only open in the summer months.

    Djurgårdsbrons Sjöcafé, Galärvarvsvägen 2 (on Djurgården, just to the right as you cross Djurgårdsbron) [35]. Only open in the summer months. Rents bikes for 250 SEK per day. Also rents roller blades and kayaks.

    Gamla Stans Cykel, Stora Nygatan 44 (T Gamla Stan) [36]. Open all year. Rents three speed city bikes for 220 SEK per day or 500 SEK for 3 days.

    Servicedepån - Cykelstallet, Scheelegatan 15 (T Rådhuset) [37]. Open all year. Rents 3 speed city bikes, 21 speed mountain/hybrids (200 SEK/day), and racers. They have metal-stud snow tyres for winter ice use, but you will have to ask in advance. Helmets are free with the bike, other accessories like panniers can also be rented. Rental period is from 10:00-18:00, full 24 hours, or several days.

Taxi
Warning: NEVER step into a taxi without checking the yellow price sign on the rear passenger window first! Taxi drivers are legally allowed to charge rip-off prices as long as they are stated clearly on the sign. The taxi to the left is twice as expensive as the one to the right. The price tag should say around SEK300 for a Stockholm cab.

Taxis are on the expensive side. Even worse is the fact that some small dodgy operators charge outrageous prices: unsuspecting visitors have been charged thousands of SEK for a trip from the airport. The antidote is to always check the black and yellow price sticker on the rear passenger window. The price shown in large digits is the maximum (for instance during night hours) fare for a 10km, 15 minute journey and reputable companies charge around SEK300 for this. If the sticker shows a much higher price, stay away or be ripped off. The taxi market was deregulated several years ago which made it considerably easier to find a taxi but the downside is that the rip-offs aren't even illegal, just "supply and demand"!

As long as you check the sticker you'll be fine, but if you're still nervous choose the major companies TopCab, +46 8 33 33 33; Taxi Kurir ☎ +46 8 30 00 00; Sverigetaxi, 020 20 20 20 (free calls from Swedish phones); and Taxi Stockholm ☎ +46 8 15 00 00. Note that many minor companies use "Stockholm" in their names to mimic their competitor, so look for the phone number 15 00 00 which appears below the logo on all Taxi Stockholm cars. Among the companies to avoid is Taxi 08 that operates at the limit of the legal rate.

Most taxi firms operate a fixed price regime between central Stockholm and Arlanda airport, mirroring the rates for the journey into town of around SEK450-500. It's a good idea to check with the driver that you will get the fixed price before you set off - the meter price for the same ride may cost twice as much. Note that the taxis often have big stickers advertising their airport price: do not confuse them with the black and yellow price sticker pictured in this article.

Authorized taxis have yellow license plates. Late at night in the city centre, you may be offered a ride with an unauthorized taxi, svarttaxi (literally "black taxi"), usually by discrete whispering of "taxi". Most of the time this will get you home for roughly the same cost as ordinary taxis, just don't ask for a receipt. Rumours say that these cabs are usually controlled by organized crime, and some unpleasant episodes have been known to happen to passengers, so try this at your own risk, and preferably not alone.
Car
Congestion fee sign

Cars driving into or out of central Stockholm between 06:30 and 18:29 on weekdays are charged a congestion tax [38] of 11 to 35 SEK. Some car rental companies charge their customers separately for the cost of toll passages, while others don't. Foreign-registered cars are NOT exempt from the tax; see [39]. Driving in Stockholm is easy compared to many larger capitals in the world. Just make sure to use your indicators when changing lanes. Fees are not charged at all in July, on holidays (such as Sundays) or on the day before a holiday (such as Saturdays).
Private Car

An alternative to taxis, bus, train & any public transport, car services are useful for getting to the airport from the outer boroughs where taxis are harder to find, or if you prefer to have transportation reserved in advance. Some options to hire a private car service in Sotkcholm: Rent a Wreck (Rent a Car) & DotTransfers (Private Car Service with chauffeur).

Parking is restricted and expensive in the centre of the city, and free parking is scarce even in the suburbs, except at external shopping centres. It is recommended for peace of mind to make use of SL services to avoid parking and congestion charges.
Boat

There are two hop-on/hop-off boat tours that run loops between various sites in Stockholm. Both cost approximately 100 SEK for a day long pass and have approximately 8 stops, including the cruise terminal, Gamla Stan, the Vasa Museum, Skansen, and Skeppsholmen.

The Stockholm archipelago is served by two major shipping companies.

Waxholmsbolaget runs inexpensive public transit ferries, slowed down by stops at several different docks. Waxholmsbolaget also runs two steamboats, that offer even slower, but genuine, round-trips with classical Swedish cuisine. [40]

Strömma is a private company, aimed at international tourists, with fast boats and audioguides. [41]

    See #Districts for listings.

Stockholm has many spectacular tourist attractions, ranging from the interesting architecture of the City Hall to the stunning natural beauty of the archipelago. In the several Royal Palaces (Stockholm Palace, Drottningholm, Haga and several others) visitors can get in close contact with traditions of the Swedish monarchy. Among the wide range of museums, the Vasa museum with its 17th century warship and the Skansen open air museum are unique experiences.
The Royal Palace in Gamla Stan.
Stockholm Riddarholmskyrkan

    Stockholm's Old Town (Gamla Stan), is the beautifully preserved historical heart of Stockholm. T Gamla Stan station is on the west side of the compact quarter, which is best covered on foot. Riddarholmskyrkan is a beautifully preserved medieval church.

    The Stockholm archipelago (skärgården) is one of the world's most spectacular. Stretching 80 kilometres east of the city centre, the archipelago comprises 24,000 islands, islets and rocks. Regular ferries are operated by Waxholmsbolaget [42] and from April through September also by Cinderellabåtarna [43].

Buildings and structures
Religious buildings

Stockholm has a large number of interesting churches, some of them dating back to medieval times. Most of them are in active use by the Lutheran Church of Sweden. There is also a synagogue and a mosque in the city center. The Skogskyrkogården cemetery, in the southern suburbs, is one of the very few UNESCO World Heritage sites from the 20th century.
Other buildings

    The Avicii Arena is a white spherical building. Occasionally, at least at game-nights, it is lit by coloured light.

With the Globe as the Sun, models of the planets are displayed at Slussen (Mercury), the Royal Institute of Technology (Venus), the Natural History Museum (Earth & Moon), Mörby Centrum (Mars), Arlanda Airport (Jupiter) and Uppsala (Saturn).

    Kungliga biblioteket (The RoyalLibrary) is the national library of Sweden. It was designed by Gustaf Dahl and is located at Humlegården T Östermalmstorg.

    The Stadsbiblioteket (The City Library) by architect Gunnar Asplund is a beautiful building in the short gap between the styles of classisism and modernism, close to T Odenplan or T Rådmansgatan.

Viewpoints

    The heights of northern Södermalm give a great view of central Stockholm. Get off the underground at Zinkensdamm, walk up the street Ringvägen and then the old and partly cobbled Yttersta tvärgränd until it terminates just next to an abandoned stone quarry on the right. Climb the quarry on either side and enjoy this somewhat steep and unprepared location, which has a tendency of attracting a pretty lively crowd on new year's eve and summer nights.
    Get off the underground at Slussen and walk up Katarinavägen and then on to the lovely Fjällgatan, where tourist coaches make a stop to let everyone enjoy the most popular vantage point.
    Hammarbybacken, a semi-artificial ski slope, walkable around the year, great during summer. (L Sickla kaj)
    Högdalstoppen, a man-made hill south of the city. See Stockholm/Southern Suburbs.
    Kaknästornet [45] contains Stockholm's highest observatory floor and restaurant, giving a good view of the central town, and the inner archipelago. Entrance fee 45 SEK.
    Skyview [46] is an elevator to the top of the Avicii Arena (Ericsson Globe). Rides cost 160 SEK a person.
    Bars and restaurants with a good view: Gondolen, Herman's, Och himlen därtill, or the penthouse lounge of Sjöfartshotellet on Södermalm, or the SAS Radisson Hotel Skybar on Norrmalm.

Cross country skiing is usually possible during the later days of December, January, February and the early days of March.
    Ice skating. Skating on natural ice is a popular way in Stockholm to enjoy the winter. Inland lakes freeze up and sometimes there can even be skated out in the archipelago. The skates used are long distance skates rather than ice hockey skates, with poles to assist. Ice skating can usually be done between January and March.

    Talk of the town memory card for your mobile phone can be rented at several bike rentals in Stockholm. Load your mobile phone with audioguides at 56 of the best sights in Stockholm. Rent by hour, 30 SEK or day 125 SEK.

Swimming

There are several beaches in inner Stockholm, as well as the suburbs. They might be crowded when Swedish people have time. The water in central Stockholm is so clean you can drink it, even though it looks dark. The quality of the water is controlled by Miljöförvaltningen (the municipal authorities) and the reports for all the beaches in the city is available online. Would there be a problem with the water, signs would be posted at the beach. If the water in Lake Mälaren is too cold for your tastes, you can opt for one of the outdoor swimming pools: Stockholm also has several indoor swimming pools and spas in very special settings, for instance Centralbadet, Sturebadet and Yasuragi spa.
Watching sports

Stockholm is home to several elite sports teams, and if you're a sports fan you might want to watch a game. The most popular spectator sports are football (soccer) and ice hockey. Also, bandy has something of a cult following. Speedway is another big spectator sport in Sweden, and it can be experienced only 16 minutes from the Central station by subway, station "Gubbängen". Handball and basketball is also available.
Football (soccer)

The Swedish National football team plays international games on Friends Arena in Solna. The Swedish top football league, Allsvenskan, is considerably weaker than most of its Western European sister leagues, and Swedish teams generally struggle in the European cups. Instead the clubs are famous for their passionate supporters. Therefore, going to a game is an exciting experience – especially the Stockholm derbies where the rivalry is intense. Unlike in continental Europe, the football season starts in the end of March and ends in the beginning of November. There are currently three teams from Stockholm in Allsvenskan: Djurgården, playing at Tele2 Arena; Hammarby, playing at Tele2 Arena and AIK, playing at Friends Arena in Solna (northern suburbs).
Ice hockey

The Swedish top ice hockey league, SHL, is one of the top leagues in the world, after North-American NHL and the Russian KHL. The season starts at the end of September and ends with finals in April. Stockholm currently has one team in SHL: Djurgården, playing their home games at Hovet.
Bandy

Bandy Bandy is a sport popular mainly in Sweden, Finland and Russia, and slowly gaining popularity in North America, played outdoors on ice with sticks and a small ball. The field is roughly as large as a football (soccer) field, and the rules show some similarities. If you visit Stockholm sometime between November and March, and want an exotic experience, this is for you. Remember to dress warm, the game is played in two 45-minute halves. Stockholm currently has one team in the top men's bandy league: Hammarby. The games are played at Zinkensdamm arena on Södermalm. (T Zinkensdamm)
Doing sports

There are many opportunities to do sports in the Stockholm area. Hellasgården is a good spot close to the city center, see Södertörn.
Skiing

The Stockholm area contains several semi-artificial ski slopes. The height is modest, but the view is usually great, well worth a hike anytime during the year. Tracks for cross-country skiing are available throughout Stockholm.
Riding

There are few stables close to the city where you can ride ponies and horses. Both available for adults and children with various riding-experience.
Golf

There are many golf courses in the Stockholm region, several of them open for green-fee.
Outdoor games

There are many open fields in Stockholm. Gärdet (T Karlaplan or T Gärdet) is a good one for outdoor sports. Just bring a ball of your choice.
Running races

    One of the most visible sporting events is the Stockholm Marathon [58], held annually on a Saturday in late May or early June, when some 18,000 participants run two laps around the inner city, while the Stockholmers gather on the sidewalks to cheer.
        Lidingöloppet [59], branded as the world's largest cross-country race, and a part of the Swedish Classic Circuit, on Lidingö in the last weekend of September.

Performances

Stockholm has several national stages, such as the Royal Swedish Opera (Kungliga Operan), and several playhouses staging international musicals.

    Stockholm Culture Festival,[60]

There is also a growing scene for stand-up comedy in Swedish and English. The Big Ben Bar, Folkungagatan 97, has a free-entrance comedy club in English each Thursday at 20:00. Skrattstock is an annual free-entrance comedy festival on Långholmen, always in May/June on the same day as the Stockholm Marathon, with at least one hour of English-language comedy.

    Live Music,[61]

The live music stage in Stockholm is something else. There are never any signs of anyone playing but a few posters in specific areas. Although a lot of the cities bar's have live music, the most common place to find it is around Södermalm. There you will find places like Debaser[62], Hornshuset[63] and Trädgården[64]. Besides Södermalm both Norrmalm[65] and Vasastan[66] have a few interesting venues.

The city hosts annual Ink Bash Tatoo convention in the end of August, different artists and vendors [67].
Cinemas

There are many cinemas in Stockholm. With the exception of children's movies, films aren't dubbed but subtitled, so if your English is good enough this is a good leisure activity. Many cinemas are THX certified. A ticket is around 145 SEK.

Many of Stockholm's most charming classic cinemas have been closed in recent years, victims of the competition from modern multiplex screens. The elegant Röda Kvarn on Biblioteksgatan was recently transformed into an Urban Outfitters store, and Astoria Nybrogatan was closed in 2007. A few splendid venues are especially worth a visit: Park, Rigoletto, Grand Sveavägen, Saga, Victoria and Skandia.
Stockholm International Film Festival
Stockholm Filmhuset

In November, Stockholm hosts an annual international film festival [68] that draws large crowds.

The Stockholm International Film Festival also hosts an open air cinema in the Tantolunden park during one week in August.

Eat

    See #Districts for listings.

Stockholm features a large variety of restaurants. However, dining in Stockholm can be expensive, if you aim for something else than the fast food bars, the run-of-the-mill British-style pubs or the ethnic restaurants that dominate the budget bracket. Be prepared to pay around 175-250 SEK or more for most main courses at quality restaurants. If you are on a tight budget, self-catering is probably the best option.

Most hotels and hostels have a good breakfast buffet, in many cases included with the room.

Most restaurants have "dagens rätt" - a lunch offer, normally including a non-alcoholic beverage, bread, butter, salad and coffee M-F, usually 11:00-14:00. Expect to pay between 65-100 SEK. Generally more expensive downtown and cheaper in the suburbs. Many Asian, Pakistani, Indian, Mexican and fast food restaurants offer rather cheap "all you can eat" lunch buffets. Office workers usually go for lunch at noon, so try to show up just before, or past 13:00.

Most restaurants' kitchens close at 22:00 even on weekends, so don't get out too late. Alcohol in restaurants is expensive. A glass of house wine can cost more than 100 SEK, or 450 SEK for a bottle. Sweden has enforced non-smoking in all bars, pubs, restaurants and enclosed areas. Smoking is usually permitted outdoors, or in designated smoking rooms/outdoor seating.

Many Stockholm restaurants are closed for vacation for a few weeks in July and/or early August. In December, many restaurants offer a "julbord" ("Christmas buffet"), a variation of the classic Swedish smörgåsbord with traditional seasonal dishes such as ham, pickled herring, "lutfisk" (stockfish from cod or ling, prepared with lye) and much more, which might require advance booking, costing around 400-600 SEK, beverages not included.

In this cosmopolitan city, traditional Swedish cuisine, known as husmanskost or husman can be hard to get by. Many fine diners have a not-too-expensive husman course: some other places to eat Swedish are the Nystekt strömming wagon (meaning "freshly fried herring") at Slussen, Ät gott (S:t Göransgatan 74, Kungsholmen) and Tennstopet (Dalagatan 50, Norrmalm).

Guide Michelin recognizes six Stockholm restaurants: Two-star Frantzén/Lindeberg [84] and Mathias Dahlgren Matsalen (including one-star Mathias Dahlgren Matbaren) [85], and one-star Esperanto [86], Fredsgatan 12 [87] and Lux [88].

    Sandys [89], several locations throughout the city: Sergelarkaden 6 (T T-Centralen), Klarabergsgatan 31 (T T-Centralen), Stureplan 2 (T Östermalmstorg) and Götgatan 28 (T Slussen). A large Stockholm-based fast food chain focusing on submarine sandwiches, wraps and salads, Sandys offer a wide selection, reliable quality and acceptable prices, although not by any means a bargain. Sandwiches 49 SEK (excluding drinks), XL sandwiches 59 SEK, salads 65 SEK.

Cafés

Taking a break for coffee and a pastry is an important Swedish tradition, called fika, and there are many coffee-bars around the city.

Swedes are among the world's most avid consumers of coffee. Espresso-based drinks (cappuccino, latte, etc.) are popular, but the most traditional type of coffee is a strong brewed/drip coffee known as bryggkaffe.

Order some baked goods like cinnamon rolls to go with the coffee. The traditional Swedish cinnamon roll is known as kanelbulle. If you prefer tea, note that many cafés only offer a few flavours, but generally some black, red, and green teas. In spring, cafés will serve a traditional seasonal pastry known as semla, which consists of a wheat bun with the top cut off, stuffed with almond paste and whipped cream.

Look at the district listings for local cafés, which offer a more personal experience, and better coffee than big chains. Expect to pay anything from 20 SEK and upwards for a cup of regular black coffee.

Don't hesitate to ask for a coffee refill (påtår [paw-tawr] in Swedish) at cafés. The second cup of coffee is traditionally free of charge, although this is rarely the case at modern chains and franchises.

Classic Stockholm cafés include, among many others: Vete-Katten and Systrarna Andersson (both in Norrmalm), Gunnarssons (Södermalm), Thelins (Kungsholmen), and Sture-Katten and Tössebageriet (both in Östermalm).
Drink

    See #Districts for listings.

Retail drinks

    Further information: Sweden#Systembolaget

Drinking alcohol is generally allowed in public areas, with some obvious exceptions, such as schools, playgrounds, indoor malls and public transport areas. In some parks, drinking is prohibited from midnight. Map of dry areas

    Systembolaget [90]. Generally open M-W 10:00-18:00, Th-F 10:00-19:00, Sa 10:00-15:00, all stores closed Su, is the government monopoly chain for selling alcohol. The stores have a wide assortment and very helpful, knowledgeable staff. Swedish alcohol taxation makes beer and hard liquor expensive. Surprisingly, more exclusive wines can be a bargain. Ask the staff for advice. You need to be able to prove that you are over 20 years old, so be sure to bring photo ID. They could occasionally ask people that are well above 30 for photo ID. For more information, see the section on Systembolaget in the Sweden article. Central locations include:
        Lilla Nygatan 18 (T Gamla Stan).
        Klarabergsgatan 62 (T T-Centralen). Extra late hours: Closes 20:00 all weekdays.
        Norrlandsgatan 3 (T T-Centralen or Kungsträdgården). The largest Systembolaget store in Stockholm, with a special selection of exclusive wines.
        Vasagatan 25 (T T-Centralen)
        Nybrogatan 47 (T Östermalmstorg)
        Folkungagatan 56 (T Medborgarplatsen)

Bars and nightclubs

The cost for drinking out in Stockholm can vary a lot. Expect to pay around 30 SEK in the cheapest pub (55-75 SEK in a trendier club or pub) for a beer or cider, and at least 95-150 SEK for a long-drink or cocktail in a club. Bars usually have no cover charge, but may have an arbitrarily set (and arbitrarily enforced) minimum age limit (usually 21 or 23, sometimes as low as 18, other times as high as 27), while clubs usually charge 50-200 SEK at the door (or more at special performances). Long, and very slow moving lines tend to form outside most popular clubs - expect having to wait as much as 1 hour or more if going to a trendy place after midnight, even if raining or snowing. Don't forget to bring an ID, as bouncers could at anytime ask for identification at the door in both pubs and clubs.

As in many other Swedish cities, clubs are quite often arranged illegally and underground outside of the city center. During the summer months, many open air parties are arranged. During fall and winter, there are underground parties in abandoned factories and other industrial buildings, like in many other cities. Some parties are only held once, while others are recurring. These are, naturally, not listed and are often informed of on a word of mouth or online community basis. Generally, such clubs play techno, house and other electronic music, and so, ask locals for advice in legal clubs that play the same genre. The Swedish word for clubs arranged illegally is svartklubb (literally black club). Due to the nature of such events, undercover police presence may be apparent and individuals could be searched for illegal substances at any moment.

Stureplan is a district dominated by posh dancefloor nightclubs, at the crossing of Birger Jarlsgatan, Kungsgatan and Sturegatan, (T Östermalmstorg). The mushroom-shaped rain shelter is a common meeting point. High entrance fees (200 SEK or more) and long lines. Can be difficult to get in to the clubs here if you are considered not fit in.

Södermalm is a district which have many smaller bars and nightclubs focusing on art and electronic or alternative music. Look in nightlife magazines for places around Hornstull (such as Strand), Mariatorget (such as Sidetrack, Marie Laveau and the Wednesday pop-club Baba Sonic) and Skanstull (such as Trädgården, Under Bron).

Major bar streets are Götgatan (where most places are rather cheap pubs) and Bondegatan (with a younger and more trendy crowd), both on Södermalm, Rörstrandsgatan in western Vasastan (also rather trendy, but drawing a slightly older crowd) and the area around the Rådhuset and Fridhemsplan subway stations on Kungsholmen (with many small, cheaper and relaxed places). There are also many local pubs outside of the city centre, where many locals go and the beer is cheaper. Ask any swedes for directions and they will be happy to help you.

LGBTQ Parties For gay and lesbian parties, visit the gay bars and ask for advice about where to go that night, since there might be limited options, and they vary from week to week. For men there are usually parties at Candy, Kingkong, Tank. Girls, ask around. Gay bars: Sidetrack, Secret garden (mixed) Lesbian bars: Bitter Pills, Whippet Lab, Secret garden (mixed) Mbargo (not a lesbian bar but many lesbians hang out there)

Most restaurants and bars close at 01:00, larger clubs usually at 03:00. There are an exclusive few open till 05:00.

More trendy clubs might have a long queue from midnight till closing time. Get out early (at least before midnight). A few posh and expensive clubs in the Stureplan district have an informal or outspoken dress code, vårdad klädsel. Do not behave drunk in queues, as the guards may not be willing to let you in. Arguing aggressively with bouncers and security staff will certainly lead to serious consequences and is not recommended.

If you can read Swedish, you can get more information about Stockholm's nightlife in the free monthly magazine Nöjesguiden, the newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Thursdays, the free QX gay magazine for LGBT events and the free Metro on Fridays.
Sleep

    See #Districts for listings.

As of 2016, Stockholm has fairly typical hotel prices for Nordic regions. You can expect to pay around 2000-2500 SEK (~€220-€270) for a double room in a 4* hotel, and anywhere from 800-1200 SEK for the cheapest 2* private double rooms. Hotels located far from city center are generally cheaper, as are hostels and private rooms without en suite bathrooms. Try to find one close to public transport. As throughout other major European cities, apartment rental services such as AirBNB provide competitive options as compared to traditional hotels.

The cheap bunks are in short supply. Look for hostels at Svenska Turistföreningen, [91] and SVIF [92] Advance booking is recommended, especially during summer, and for those in the inner city. Stockholm has some spectacular hostels, such as af Chapman at Skeppsholmen, [93], Långholmen [94], Jumbostay [95] at Arlanda, and Best Hostel at the Old Town waterfront [96].

The lowest cost per bed can be found on the Baltic Sea cruiseferries.
Contact
Phone

Phone booths are very rare as are public phones in general as most people have switched to cell phones. Prepaid cards are available and usually also include Internet access at a reasonable price. Coverage is excellent in Stockholm, even in the subway and road tunnels.
Internet access

There are a number of places where you can access the Internet in central Stockholm.

An alternative for any visitor to Sweden is to buy a pre-paid USB 3G/4G modem. These can be had cheaply (down to 150 SEK) and the 3G/4G coverage in Stockholm is excellent. Expect to pay around 100 SEK/week or 300 SEK/month to use the 3G modem. Data limits are typically high (5 GB/Month but up to 20 GB or more is also available)


WiFi

Many cafés, hotels, libraries offer free wi-fi access. McDonalds and the local version Max also offers good free Wifi in their restaurants. The site Wifikartan show most of the free wi-fi access points in Stockholm and most of Sweden as well.

    Skype offers wi-fi access in some areas called Skype Zones [97]. This service used to be offered for free as a test, but now seems to be subject to a fee.

    Telia HomeRun [98] is a commercial wi-fi service that covers many points in central Stockholm with wi-fi.

Internet terminals

    The company Sidewalk Express operates internet terminals in a number of convenience stores (most 7 Eleven and many Pressbyrån stores) and some other shops and public locations, including the main hall in the Stockholm Central railway station. Check their website [99] for a full list of locations. Most terminals are however quite uncomfortable to use (metallic keyboards, stand-up only access etc.) and fairly expensive. Unused time from one Sidewalk Express location can be reused at any other terminal in Sweden within 5 days.

    You can often use the internet for free at the public libraries (but you may have to ask first). Big libraries can be found at Medborgarplatsen (T Medborgarplatsen) and Sveavägen 73 (T Odenplan).

    The Central Station has Stockholmspanelen, information terminals with keyboards and web browsers that have full internet access but no address bar to type in the URL of the site you want to visit. But if you are clever there's a way to get to Google, you can then type in the URL you want to visit and hit "Search".

    There are also a number of more gaming-oriented internet points. These are often open late nights.
        Matrix — The underground hall in the Kungsgatan exit of the metro station Hötorget. Open Su-Th 10:00-24:00, F-Sa 10:00-03:00. A centrally located 80-terminal gamer den with generous opening hours.
        Inferno Online, situated at Odenplan (metro station). The largest gaming/internet-cafe in the world. If you are a new user you need to create an account (free) and then pay for the amount of hours you want on your account (the prices are low compared to other internet terminals). Their website: http://www.infernoonline.com/

Stay safe

Stockholm is a safe city by international standards. As in other cities, however, you should avoid late-night walks through deserted areas of the city or through unlit parks.

Stockholm has an exciting night-life. As in most countries, being overly intoxicated is not accepted in most bars and clubs, and could lead to the security staff forcibly ejecting the trouble-maker. Swedish people tend to binge-drink, and as usual, alcohol might fuel violence.

Most crimes against tourists are crimes of opportunity, such as pick-pocketing, bicycle theft, auto theft, and auto vandalism. As always, do not leave valuable items in your car, and watch your bag in crowded places. Most shops and all major taxi companies accept credit and debit cards, so there is no need to carry a lot of cash. Be more aware of your belongings in crowded areas such as festivals, nightclubs, markets, airports, and public transport areas.

Prefer the major cab companies (Taxi Stockholm, Taxi Kurir, Sverigetaxi and Topcab) to avoid overcharging, and have a better chance of having belongings lost in the car returned to you.

During summer, groups of street gamblers try to scam their audience on Drottninggatan and in other touristed areas. They use a variety of tricks one of them being planting a few of their own in the crowd. Don't play, you will lose.

Though Sweden has an extensive welfare system, impoverished people can be seen begging all over town. Most of these people are Romani who travel from Eastern Europe to Stockholm just to beg for money. It is not recommended to give them money but rather a responsible way to address their situation is to buy the street paper, Situation Stockholm, for 50 SEK. You may also come upon beggars feigning disabilities, or handing out laminated begging cards on the subway. Buying food or water for someone begging is also a good way of helping, without risking that your money goes in the wrong hands.

Stockholm is a very friendly to sexual minorities. Homophobic and transphobic attitudes will be met with outright hostility from many swedes. All parties in the Swedish parliament take a radical standpoint against harassment and violence towards sexual minorities. Same-sex couples will have no trouble living openly in Stockholm, which includes holding hands or kissing in public around the city. Despite this fact, common sense should be used late at night in some areas. The openness towards sexual minorities is not shared by the communities living in many of the cities poorer suburbs and being openly gay there might be right out dangerous.
Respect

    When using escalators, the rule is to stand on the right and to use the left side for walking up the stairs. On train and subway platforms, wait at the side of the door to allow all passengers leave the car before attempting to board. Failure to respect these rules can annoy locals considerably, especially during rush hour.

    Avoid walking in the cycle lane. Dedicated cycle paths are clearly marked, but sometimes run directly next to the pavement (sidewalk). Stockholm cyclists are subject to a comparatively hilly landscape and are unwilling to slow down and lose momentum. Usually, however, they are careful, signal clearly and use their bells, meaning that straying tourists most often are just cursed at.

    When waiting in lines, be patient and polite. Swedes seldom jump queues - but make sure you actually stand in the line. If unsure, ask.

    Personal space is important to Swedes, and it tends to be more expansive than in other cultures. Avoid standing very close to another person or taking a seat immediately next to another passenger, unless necessary.

    Many Swedes are annoyed by attention-seeking or intrusive behavior. Speaking very loudly and playing music in public spaces/on public transport, or using telephones on speaker mode, are generally frowned upon.

    Swedes tend to silently expect others to be mindful of local norms, including personal space and queuing, but many will also avoid direct interventions or criticism. Irritation over perceived transgressions may instead be expressed through small, subtle signs that can be difficult to pick up on, or not articulated at all. However, most are happy to assist or explain if asked.

Cope

Some things to pack:

    See also Sweden#Bring.

    Comfortable shoes. Stockholm is best experienced on foot.
    An umbrella or a raincoat for wet weather.
    Warm clothes in good materials (Long johns/stockings under your pants/skirt will keep you warm without looking like you wear your ski-outfit).

Getting cash

There are many ATMs in the city, but some foreign card-holders, such as a Canadian, have reported trouble in using them, even when they purport to be connected to international networks their banks are part of, so consider doing some research before you arrive.

There are many locations of a currency exchange called Forex, but they charge a whopping 50 SEK (4.7 €) commission on top of their buy-sell spread.

Credit/debit cards are widely accepted even for small amounts. Most places accept identification and a signature, but PIN-transactions are preferred.
Toilets

Finding a good toilet in Stockholm can be tricky. Many department stores and fast-food restaurants have clean toilets, often for the charge of 5 SEK. That is also the cost of public toilet booths found in most city squares (though these might be messy) so be sure to carry some 5 and 10 SEK coins. Restaurants' toilets are often reserved for customers, and might be messy depending on the establishment. Some good, clean toilets are found in Max at Norrmalmstorg, and in the bar Sturehof (at Stureplan - the establishment is too big for crew to keep track of people borrowing the toilet). Urinating in town is illegal, but urinals are often free even if you have to pay for a WC. The libraries, museums, and government buildings often have free, clean toilets.

Most major hotels have clean lobby toilets. Some of them might be reserved for house guests and require an access code, but travellers can often get access to them on request.
Laundry

Since all Swedish apartments either have a washing machine or access to a communal laundry room, there are virtually no self-service laundries to be found in Stockholm, with one exception:

    Tvättomaten, Västmannagatan 61 (T Odenplan), + 46 8 34 64 80, [100]. Open M-F 08:30-18:30, Sa 09:30-15:00 (closed Sa from end of June to mid-August, closed one week at the end of July). Self service price: 50 SEK without drying, 100 SEK with drying (per machine, up to 5 kg).

Most youth hostels have washing machines. Some dry cleaners offer to wash shirts and bed linen as well, but this tends to be quite expensive.
Health

Swedish healthcare is generally of high quality, although you may have to face a long wait in emergency rooms. How fast you get to see the doctor is dependent on how ill you are and if others are sicker. If you have a small wound that needs stitches you will wait if there are victims of a car-accident. But if you are in a bad car-accident you know you will get help first. Money, name or title won't help pass the queue.

EU/EES citizens with a European Health Insurance card pay the same (rather low) fee for emergency and necessary care as a local citizen. Others must pay the whole health care cost (which can be between 1,700 and 2,200SEK for a doctor’s visit at an emergency care unit at a hospital). More information on hospital fees can be found on the Stockholm County information site [101].

In an emergency, always call 112 for SOS Alarm, for ambulance, police, fire service, air and sea rescue, mountain patrol, or priest on call. English-speaking operators are available.

There are two hospitals with 24-hour emergency care units in the inner city:

    S:t Görans Sjukhus, S:t Göransplan 1 (T Fridhemsplan or T Stadshagen), +46 8 58 70 10 00, [102].
    Södersjukhuset, Sjukhusbacken 10 (Bus 3, 74 or 164 from T Skanstull, bus 74 from T Mariatorget or commuter train to Stockholm Södra), +46 8 616 10 00, [103].

For less serious illnesses and ailments, getting in touch with a local clinic, vårdcentral, is a much better option than the hospital emergency rooms. The Stockholm County healthcare hotline Vårdguiden (+46 8 320 100, [104]) can give medical advice and help you find a doctor. While information is officially given in Swedish only, the doctors can often speak some English.
Pharmacies

The pharmacy market has recently been de-regulated, giving some competition to the state-operated monopoly chain Apoteket. Certified pharmacies have a green cross sign. You can buy over-the-counter medicine (such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, throat and cough relief tablets or nose-sprays) in almost any supermarket or convenience store.

    Apoteket C W Scheele, Klarabergsgatan 64 (T T-Centralen), +46 8 454 81 30. This pharmacy is centrally located and open 24 hours, all days of the week, including holidays. Service is limited late at night, and can be slow, but they have a very large inventory of specialized drugs.
    Apotek Hjärtat, Krukmakargatan 13 (T Mariatorget). Located on Södermalm, with extra long operating hours: 08:00-22:00 all days of the week.

Tap water
The tap water in Stockholm is of very high quality. There is no reason for buying bottled water, which often is of lower quality than, or actually is, tap water. It is also completely accepted to ask for tap water in restaurants. Many places have a tap and glasses for self-service.
