A big and bright red wood-burning oven is not merely a visual centerpiece at 21 Greenpoint, it is also the soul of Chef/owner Homer Murray's thoroughly pleasing American fare. Similarly, the space oozes with that appealingly familiar feel, featuring plank floors, mosaics and disheveled walls. There are dishes for every mood on this daily changing menu, from vegetables, pastas and wood-fired pizzas (on Wednesdays) to fish, meats and wonderful desserts. If on offer, try the roasted artichoke hearts with saffron aioli and roasted pumpkin seeds, with a side of freshly made sesame-crusted focaccia, of course! Spaghetti Meg Ryan is a saucy plate of pasta tucked with bocconcini for a deliciously creamy twirl.

Are there any rules about showering a scoop of honey-infused vanilla cream with grated Parmesan cheese? Is there a consensus on whether an entire orb of creamy burrata goes well with rice cakes and gochujang-marinated chicken? There's a first time for everything at this rambunctious little restaurant in the Lower East Side. The team works with a solid foundation of Korean flavors and from there, springboards into uncharted waters. Creative, bold dishes – all of which beg to be shared – run up and down this menu. Those wanting to stick to something more familiar will not leave disappointed. The pan-fried scallion-parsley pancake makes for a superb start, followed by tender medallions of grilled Iberico pork galbi resting in a pool of spicy red chili paste.

The menu, now entirely electronic, is lengthy but the glamorous photos are accurate reflections of what's to come. Chicken dumplings sitting in a pool of red chili sauce, and tender rolls of pork belly with sesame cold noodles are sensible starters for a meal that ramps up quite quickly thanks to a lightning-fast kitchen. In a flash, the table crowds with fiery bowls of mapo tofu and cauldrons of braised beef spiked with roasted chilies. Indeed, chilies, spices and heat are used to powerful, delicious effect.

Oregano roasted chicken tacos are simply finished with avocado-chipotle aioli and salsa cruda, or order the skewer of octopus, pork belly and potatoes over poblano rice. Churros with acacia honey and chocolate atole sauce are just right.

This charming Indian restaurant gem, set on a quiet Sunnyside street with its bright orange awning, is a true neighborhood essential. A somewhat cumbersome menu conceals the true talent behind this kitchen, which specializes in clearly defined, utterly delicious curries. The chef hails from Goa so start first with everything listed under the "Indo Portuguese" section. Lamb vindaloo, for instance, is a spicy, almost electric effort; while the Goan fish curry offers a more creamy, soothing bite. Cashew nuts, onions and fenugreek leaves work wonders in the methi curry. Classics like tandoori lamb chops marinated in yogurt and tamarind arrive wonderfully tender and expertly charred. Know that the kitchen takes its time, but the wait is well worth it.

Instead, they are sent out in a sensible order, for the benefit of the diner rather than the convenience of the kitchen.The cuisine is nominally influenced by the Costa Brava, but its reach is far greater than that and the tapas are especially refined.

Beyond an ordinary façade lies this serene, shoes-off retreat with traditional low tables, Korean artifacts and meditative music. While wine and beer are available, a pot of royal green tea from Mt.

The ssam bap offers a fun DIY experience with a long platter of fillings. Dark leafy lettuce and thin, herbaceous sesame leaves are topped with creamy slices of avocado, crunchy bean sprouts, pickled daikon, carrot, cucumber, radish and three rice options—white, brown and a nutty, purple-tinged multigrain.

There's nothing like a discreet entrance to raise expectations—and Hirohisa is nicely concealed on Thompson Street. When you do find it, you enter into a stylish and beautifully understated room. There are tables and dining a la carte is an option, but it's so much more satisfying to sit at the counter for the omakase. The menu is structured as a kaiseki experience. Two things will quickly become clear: the ingredients are exceptional and the team's technical skills are considerable. This is food that is as rewarding to eat as it is restorative. Standouts include a chilled eggplant composition with Japanese abalone to mark the season. The meal concludes with a satisfying pot of rice, dressed with the likes of diced squid and tomatoes or salmon belly and ikura.

Sometimes you can hear the sound of sizzling woks in the kitchen of this Sichuan dining venture. It's a good omen in Long Island City, which isn't known for its Asian cuisine but may be soon, thanks to Hupo. The sleek space is narrow and long, with dark hardwood floors and lofty ceilings.Such a quaint setting is an apt pairing for the small, focused menu that features regional favorites like spicy mapo tofu, house-made cold noodles slicked in a sweet and spicy chili oil, as well as Chungking spicy chicken. Nothing blasts of heat here, so spice junkies are unlikely to break a sweat. Still, dishes like stewed fish fillet in hot chili soup arrive chock-full of minced garlic and channel the kind of fiery, umami-driven complexity we crave from this cuisine.

The longevity of Chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten's flagship is due to many factors—a sumptuous setting, a discreet aura and superior French cuisine. Dishes showcase everything from attention to detail and impeccable products to thoughtful garnishes and nuanced flavors. The omnivore menu is appealingly versatile thanks to contemporary accents and classic techniques. A supple day-boat scallop over crispy "sushi" rice a light opener, while roasted cauliflower tea is delicate, warm and frothy with a pop of citrus from Santa Teresa lemons. Smoked potato pierogi has an earthy flavor, and a generous dollop of caviar ups the luxe quotient. From sea bass to venison loin, main dishes are satisfying, but the desserts are dazzling works of art and are an elegant conclusion to a sophisticated meal.

If that doesn't have your taste buds tingling, the kitchen's concise number of unique items at a steal of a price will hit the spot. Persian cucumber kimchi with a spicy plum dressing, shiso and sesame seeds is a delight, while the aroma of pork bone broth that precedes the arrival of gochu ramyun brimming with curly noodles, bean sprouts and pickled cabbage is a veritable thesis on ace ingredients.

The stylish restaurant group now runs multiple locations across the region, but this Flushing location is the original. Roast Beijing duck is a signature order that comes with thin pancakes on a silver tray. Fiery mapo tofu in a portion fit for four and one particularly thrilling sliced beef in golden pepper sauce are also must-orders.

Several years in, and Chef Hoyoung Kim and his team continue to deliver their promise of a nicely poised, modern Korean prix-fix that is both familiar and substantial. Jook with smoked eel and sesame is as comforting as it is refined, while crispy seaweed cradling tuna tartare and rice capped with caviar is as luxurious of a start as one could hope for. Have you ever seen a banchan as minimalist and as impactful as this one? Probably not. Dinner typically ends with a glazed Korean-style donut and a silky-smooth orb of ice cream. All the while, this slim and sleek restaurant is right at home being in such close proximity to the Flatiron Building thanks to its soaring ceilings, sultry lighting and a packed dining room humming with energy.

Jungsik's "New Korean" cuisine leans westwards. Indeed, some of this kitchen's wonderful sauces wouldn't be out of place at a grand French table, but what is most impressive here is that the Korean elements of the dishes seem to raise them to another level. Bibimbap composed with gochujang, crispy quinoa and tender Wagyu beef tartare will live long in the memory; while the branzino served simply with white kimchi shows that this is also a kitchen with the utmost confidence in the quality of its ingredients.This is cooking that is original, impeccably executed and enormously satisfying. It's the sort of food that makes you involuntarily nod to yourself while you're eating. The space is cool, crisp and elegant; the service team sharp, keen and organized.

From the selection of fish (largely sourced from Toyosu Market) to the variety of dishes, a meal here hits all the right notes. It all begins with appetizers reminiscent of Japanese cuisine, followed by nigiri sushi with a blend of Koshihikari and Nanatsuboshi rice, amply vinegared to showcase the flavor of the fish. Some courses have already become signatures, including a hand roll layered with creamy petals of uni, and the elegant ikura.

One of the last-standing, old-time Eastern European spots on the Lower East Side, Katz’s is a true NY institution. It’s crowded, crazy and packed with a panoply of characters weirder than a jury duty pool. Tourists, hipsters, blue hairs and everybody in between flock here, so come on off-hours. Because it’s really that good. Walk inside, get a ticket and don’t lose it (those guys at the front aren’t hosts—upset their system and you’ll get a verbal beating). Then pick up your food at the counter and bring it to a first-come first-get table; or opt for a slightly less dizzying experience at a waitress-served table.Nothing’s changed in the looks or taste. Matzo ball soup, pastrami sandwiches, potato latkes—everything is what you’d expect, only better.

The idea that tasting menus are hours-long and showy is far from true here. The vibe is boisterous, and the crowds are delighted to be here. 
The open kitchen is the obvious centerpiece. From here, a young team blitzes out an array of impressive grilled bites meant to be eaten with your hands—Kochi is Korean for skewer, after all.
Chef Sungchul Shim taps into his Korean roots and fine-dining pedigree to create a solid but playful menu. Start with sweet potato and sunchoke gratin paired with a clever doenjang béchamel, then salmon bibimbap, mingling pollock roe, candied anchovy and toasted nori with brown soy-butter rice, is a harmonious high point. A stick of rich and nutty black sesame ice cream is the last hurrah. Worth the splurge? Without a doubt.

While seafood remains Ripert's passion, his vegetarian tasting menu makes waves with dishes like the Himalayan morel, spring pea and fava bean casserole or the warm artichoke panaché with vegetable risotto and Périgord black truffle vinaigrette.

A selection of "gourmandises" showcases such exemplary classics as pike quenelles or sautéed sweetbreads, which achieve prominent flavor when paired with tomato crème. This may be tailed by beef cheek and foie gras terrine in a pitch-perfect sherry vinaigrette. A venerated rabbit dish is presented as three acts: gently braised legs in a clear consommé with vegetables; stuffed saddle with a rustic pan sauce; and the rest matched with delicious mustard-enrobed onions.

The communal tables encourage lingering, perhaps over the likes of on-site baked breads and fresh pastas.

Dazzling versions of doenjang, gochujang, ganjang and ssamjang shine with silky tofu, fried pancakes, Miyazaki beef and Niman Ranch pork. He brings the room together and impresses with carefully calibrated dishes that appear strikingly minimalist. Details are impressive, and many of the service pieces are handmade from Korean clay.

The winding, cavernous setting includes a communal table, exposed brick, and low ceilings. Dinner could go in any numbers of directions. Some opt for the dry pot in which diners customize their ingredients—meat, seafood, vegetables, rice—and degree of spiciness. The possibilities here are nearly infinite. Those who aren't up for making so many decisions swing for Sichuan classics. Recent highlights include the cold husband and wife appetizer (braised beef and tripe), warm dan dan noodles, and a particularly elegant white fish with pickled vegetables. Nothing is an intense barn-burner in terms of spiciness.

Further back is the ever-immersive sushi counter, as well as a semi-private area with a large table. Temaki or hand rolls—don't miss the fantastic vegan options—are front-and-center, along with other items like a vegetable miso soup with fried tofu and shishito. Hungry diners will revel in the chef's set, which may uncover such delectable combos as salmon, onion cream, and tomato in toasted nori. Topped with scallions, chopped toro on wasabi rice is hard to resist; not unlike the broiled crab with spicy mayo that arrives in a nori shell studded with Rice Crispies for a delightfully inventive treat.

Speedy servers steer diners through the varied menu—and perhaps even away from such delicacies as prawn mee, an exceptionally spiced and sour shrimp broth with noodles, pork, vegetables and bean sprouts floating in its goodness. Some know to stick to such faithful and deeply satisfying dishes as nasi lemak, which is a delightful combo of coconut rice, pickled veggies, crispy anchovies, curried chicken and hard-boiled egg. The chow kueh teow, with stir-fried noodles, tiger prawns and squid, is a go-to dish, while coconut batter-fried jumbo prawns are another winner.

A Dia de los Muertos mural marks the wall opposite the open kitchen, where you'll see industrious cooks working the grill and pressing house-made corn tortillas at a steady clip, which helps explain why they're always so wonderfully tender and fresh. The tacos, like a spot-on al pastor, are of course excellent, as are homey offerings like braised chicken salsa verde enchiladas, smothered in melted queso Oaxaca.

The room is lively and packed but always conducive to conversation.Tacos are the main draw, especially when piled with the likes of tender flank steak or soft-shell crab. However, this kitchen team doesn't stick to merely one dish or area of Mexico. Instead, they reach widely across a myriad of regions, always balancing abundance with fresh and vibrant flavors. The menu thereby tempts and tantalizes with such large and small items as the tropical hamachi agua chile and tlayuda crafted from smoky corn on a shell. Other standouts include the brined, fried and smoked "giant chicken."Apprised diners know never to pass up on creative and clever delicacies like the hoja santa curd, accompanied by roasted strawberries, raspberry granita, and finished with spicy olive oil.

An experience at Thomas Keller's Per Se is one to be savored, recounted and remembered. Despite stellar views and a clever design allowing each table a view, your attention won't stray from the plate. Such is the appeal of the place.
There are two menus, one of which is vegetarian and may highlight a playful twist on borscht, with red beet agnolotti and crème fraîche. Both menus end in a grand dessert finale, like seasonal confections as well as such classics as a cappuccino semifreddo served with brioche donuts. They do offer supplements using lavish ingredients, but unless you’re richer than Croesus, you needn’t consider them.

However, that would be a shame, as the tasting menu, under the calm leadership of Chef Samuel Clonts, is anything but ordinary. In fact, diners can expect a wonderful and surprising meal with an eye towards finesse.
From lush hamachi with shiso pepper-saturated Meyer lemon curd to juicy-crispy chicken roulade over a puree of miso and spicy mole, this kitchen team treats its top-quality ingredients with refined techniques. Inspired by his time in Arizona and at Bar Uchu, Chef Clonts prepares a taco with soft ajitama, fried potato and smoked trout roe; as well as a hand roll full of caviar and rice.

Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking
There are a ton of Japanese restaurants that line this stretch of the East Village, so why Sobaya? Why not Sobaya, its ultra-dedicated patrons would argue, for the buckwheat soba, as well as the hearty udon on tap here, are consistently off-the-charts good. Co-owner and mini-mogul, Bon Yagi, favors authenticity over flash in his establishments. And here he employs that traditional aesthetic to sweet perfection—along with a graceful, but simply appointed dining space; and quiet, well-timed service.

Every meal at this Bushwick tortilleria must begin with a basket of chips and guacamole. Chef-owners and husband-and-wife Zack and Diana Wangeman are humble about the only appetizer on the menu, but what a start it is. The chips are freshly fried, made in-house in the same kitchen where you can watch the team nixtamalize, mill and knead heritage Mexican corn into beautiful, soft tortillas. Worthy of their own commercial bottling, vibrant, beautifully spiced salsas like avocado-lime, garlicy tuom, chile de arbol and chile morita also arrive right away, ready to dress anything and everything. The menu is focused on tacos with steak, marinated pork or cauliflower. Other items include enchiladas de mole negro.

This fresh concept's name is derived from Italy's tradition of hand-crafted sodas; and its spirit from the turbulent Prohibition era. Pass the entry sign to arrive at this mini haven, replete with a mighty vintage vibe—think velvet chairs, gleaming copper accents and stained glass lamps.On the menu, house-made pastas are a focus. There are also natural wines to accompany the seasonal, deftly executed vegan dishes. Toasted focaccia served in a miso bagna cauda is an umami-rich bite, tailed by tagliatelle tossed with nori "butter" sauce and broccoli rabe. Date cake with vanilla "gelato" gets a hit of black salt for delicious complexity.

Named for a racehorse and just as focused and quick, Speedy Romeo is in for a successful run. Part tavern, part roadside grill, its kitschy décor and modern touches transform this former automotive shop into a surprisingly attractive spot. The owner benefited from years at Jean-Georges' empire, and that intelligence and experience is conveyed through the smart accents and whimsical menu that begins with Italian ingredients. Look to the wood-burning oven for smoky, meaty artichoke halves topped with lemon aïoli, sourdough crumbs, mint and peppery arugula. Take a chance on the non-traditional but utterly fantastic pizza combinations, such as the St. Louis, layering a proper crust with meats, pickled chillies and Midwestern Provel cheese.

Bib Gourmand: good quality, good value cooking
What began with a handful of seats and vegetarian burgers has evolved with a new location and new menu. Brooks Headley's first-come, first-served spot, with vintage diner vibes, is squarely in the middle of the East Village and the new menu is equal parts quirky and contemporary, and fully vegetarian (even sometimes vegan). It's very creative, as in sweet and sour beets over jalapeño cream cheese and pretzels. Yes, it sounds weird, but it works. Cabbage filled with sticky rice and oyster mushrooms has plenty of character, and the burger crafted from quinoa, chickpeas, carrots and walnuts is how they made their name. All of the desserts are worth trying, especially the peanut butter pie and the seared malt cake with house-made cream cheese gelato that punches way above its weight.

He now finds himself in Tribeca behind a 10-seat counter made from gorgeous cedar wood. In some ways, there are no surprises: He works meticulously and at his own pace, slicing fish flown in from Japan three times a week. His rice is defined and generally warm, and his uni and caviar sandwich as well as his double and triple-layer tuna nigiri are still signatures. There's just one thing: the price is steep, but that doesn't faze his regulars, of which there are many. But regular or not, he treats everyone like a guest of his home.

They require confirmation and punctuality, but to culinary diehards, this is just the cost of admission.The counter is where the action happens. An experience here depends entirely on the itamae in front of you, as their signature style will guide your meal. For the most part, their omakase lives up to the hype by ignoring new trends and sticking to classically assembled sushi. Each item is handled with care, highlighting their robust flavor. Imagine the likes of cherrystone clam, bluefin tuna and sayori with shiso. Nigiri, like Maine and Japanese uni tastings, showcase the subtle differences in these flavorful bites.
